      <description>You have a technical blog and you might have built it from scratch.

There is only one problem: no one is reading what you write.
Why?
Do you want to know the answer? It&amp;rsquo;s going to hurt.
Here it goes:

      <description>When you&amp;rsquo;re banging your head against the wall trying to fix a bug, the last thing you want is having to stop and learn how to use the debugging tool.
The last time this happened, you added require &#39;pry&#39; on a ruby file but quickly realized you didn&amp;rsquo;t know the available commands. What&amp;rsquo;s that noise? Oh, it&amp;rsquo;s the sound of more frustration being added to your day!
If only there was a way for you to quickly learn how to use Pry&amp;hellip; Well, there is now!</description>

      <description>What is Open Source Thursdays? Did you always want to contribute to Rails but can&amp;rsquo;t get past getting overwhelmed and scared when looking at a big project by yourself?
That&amp;rsquo;s how we felt! We thought, why not do it live so other people can join us?
Neither of us has done this before. The plan is to get there and do everything live, no preparing in advance. Just the real work.</description>

      <title>Growing a Micro-SaaS to 30K MRR and 20K Users with DelightChat</title>

      <description>We had a great time chatting with Preetam Nath and Sankalp Jonna, the co-founders of SuperLemon and DelightChat.
They started a micro-SaaS in 2019. After about 14 months, they grew the monthly recurring revenue to $30,000. More than 20,000 merchants are using their product on the Shopify App Store, which is completely insane!
DelightChat is a customer support tool for small and medium-sized e-commerces.
The great thing about their story is that they&amp;rsquo;re not just building a business, but building a life on top of that business.</description>
