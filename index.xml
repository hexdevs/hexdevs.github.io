      <description>If youâ€™ve been following us for a while, you know we are super passionate about FIRE/financial independence.
Five years ago, we didn&amp;rsquo;t even know where our money was going. Our dream of moving abroad felt so far away: we didn&amp;rsquo;t have any money. But we knew we had to do something about it!
We made a promise: that we would never have problems with money anymore.
We started budgeting, investing, and growing our net worth.</description>

      <title>Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters</title>

      <description>About Shape Up Shape Up is an agile product development approach used internally by Basecamp. It has three distinct phases:
 Shaping  The product strategy team writes a pitch that describes the problem that needs to be solved, giving as much detail as needed, and proposes a solution. The level of detail should be specific enough so that the team working on the project knows what to do. It should also leave enough room so the team can figure out the best way to build a solution that fits scope and budget constraints.</description>
