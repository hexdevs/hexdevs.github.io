      <description>You have a technical blog and you might have built it from scratch.
You wrote a bunch of great tutorials. Your posts are perfect. You are a smart person and you want to show your developer expertise.
There is only one problem: no one is reading what you write.
Why?
Do you want to know the answer? It&amp;rsquo;s going to hurt.

      <description>When you&amp;rsquo;re banging your head against the wall trying to fix a bug, the last thing you want is having to stop and learn how to use the debugging tool.
The last time this happened, you added require &#39;pry&#39; on a ruby file but quickly realized you didn&amp;rsquo;t know the available commands. What&amp;rsquo;s that noise? Oh, it&amp;rsquo;s the sound of more frustration being added to your day!
If only there was a way for you to quickly learn how to use Pry&amp;hellip; Well, there is now!</description>

      <description>We had a great time chatting with Preetam Nath and Sankalp Jonna, the co-founders of SuperLemon and DelightChat.
They started a micro-SaaS in 2019. After about 14 months, they grew the monthly recurring revenue to $30,000. More than 20,000 merchants are using their product on the Shopify App Store, which is completely insane!
DelightChat is a customer support tool for small and medium-sized e-commerces.
The great thing about their story is that they&amp;rsquo;re not just building a business, but building a life on top of that business.</description>
