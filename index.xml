      <description>Everyone says delivering a technical talk is a great opportunity to connect with people, build your reputation, create opportunities to grow your career. Here at hexdevs, we even recommend people to just don&amp;rsquo;t go to meetups&amp;hellip; but to talk at meetups!
When you finally decide to do it, the fear of tackling public speaking pops up. Is public speaking a required skill for a Software Engineer? What are you even going to talk about it?</description>

      <description>You look at the clock: it&amp;rsquo;s 5 PM.
You&amp;rsquo;ve been sitting on a chair for the past ~8 hours&amp;hellip; Or worse: just endless, mind-numbing meetings all day. No wonder why you don&amp;rsquo;t feel like opening up a technical book or watching tutorials after work.
Even so, you try to push yourself one more time because you want to keep growing in your career.
You try to finish one exercise from the latest technical material you‚Äôve invested in.</description>

      <description>Are you afraid you&amp;rsquo;ll be stuck forever as an intermediate developer? When you ask for advice on how you can level up to become a Senior, people throw you an endless list of complex technical skills that you have to learn to get to Senior.
Ruby on Rails internals, Scaling, DevOps, Kubernetes, Testing, OOP, Database Optimization‚Ä¶
Oh yeah, not to mention the leadership and management skills you also have to develop on top of that.</description>

      <description>Do you feel like you&amp;rsquo;re an experienced developer&amp;hellip; But not experienced enough to make the jump to Senior?
Are you afraid you&amp;rsquo;ll be stuck forever as an intermediate developer?
With so many years of experience, it&amp;rsquo;s gotta be enough to have some Senior-level skills to show for it, right?
Well, not really. Practicing beyond the basics is still a struggle. Because you don&amp;rsquo;t have many opportunities to get experience with advanced skills on the job.</description>

      <description>Have you been applying to jobs hoping to get your career to the next level, but getting rejected every time?
Are you afraid you&amp;rsquo;ll be stuck forever as an intermediate developer?
3 to 5 years of experience as a Ruby on Rails developer gotta be enough to eventually land a better job, right?
It seems the only thing you can do is to just keep applying for more jobs. And hope for the best.</description>

      <description>This article is the second part of the Science of Expertise series. Before reading along, read The Science of Expertise: introduction to Perceptual Learning. the resources mentioned in this series is also found at the end.
A Better Way to Practice Ruby: Deliberate Practice Perceptual Learning results are promising.
Unfortunately, no research has been made for programming yet. In this article, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn what we apply from what&amp;rsquo;s been published regarding Perceptual Learning in several domains.</description>

      <guid>https://www.hexdevs.com/posts/perceptual-learning-introduction/</guid>
      <description>How do you become an expert? Why some Ruby developers can&amp;rsquo;t explain what they know? Why some developers don&amp;rsquo;t develop expert skills? What does it mean to be a Ruby expert?
To discuss these questions, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore Perceptual Learning (PL) research.
PL is a natural learning process that complements traditional Education. It accelerates expertise by speeding pattern recognition, intuition and fluency on a given subject.
Ever since I found out about Perceptual Learning in the book &amp;ldquo;Badass - Making users awesome&amp;rdquo;, from Kathy Sierra, I got really curious to learn more about the science behind Perceptual Learning.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Can you help me build out my developer portfolio?&amp;rdquo;
 It&amp;rsquo;s the first question early-career developers ask when they book a mentoring call with me.
They&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling to find their first developer job. They read an article or a friend tells them they should be focusing on building their tech portfolio. Or they just decided to follow generic advice on the internet.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been mentoring people for many years, and the portfolio question is the first thing they ask me.</description>

      <guid>https://www.hexdevs.com/posts/code-quality-ruby-on-rails/</guid>
      <description>Does it take forever to ship even small features on the codebase you&amp;rsquo;re working on? Is the code hard to understand and maintain? Are projects always running over budget? Are you constantly sacrificing code quality and not paying down technical debt?
When you change one feature, does another completely unrelated part of your app stop working? New bugs appear, even though tests never break? ü•µ
Those are signs that you are suffering from working on a codebase with low code quality.</description>

      <description>Are you looking for courses, training, and resources to improve your Ruby and Ruby on Rails skills, but you are not being paid in US dollars?
Most Ruby and Ruby on Rails books and courses are priced in US dollars. When you can&amp;rsquo;t afford them just because the country you live in has an undervalued currency compared to the dollar, it makes it difficult to invest in your education.
There are many free options you probably already know about, and you&amp;rsquo;re already using them.</description>

      <description>Are you having a hard time picking up the syntax of a new programming language, even though you know how to code?
You&amp;rsquo;re new to Ruby, and people say it&amp;rsquo;s an easy language, but you find the syntax difficult to understand.
You know a bit of Javascript, Python, Java, or any other language. But Ruby seems like alien technology to you.

      <description>You want to write smooth professional-looking code.
You&amp;rsquo;re craving some squeaky-clean code. But all you have for lunch every day is a big bowl of legacy spaghetti code.
You consider yourself a decent developer, but you&amp;rsquo;re never sure how to organize a project. How to name things. Where some piece of business logic should live.
How can you become a Ruby on Rails expert if the code you read every day stinks?</description>

      <description>One of my readers asked:
 How do you get started when you join a new company? How do you add features to a codebase that is massive, scary, and completely new to you?
 The first day at your new developer job is just like the first day at a new school. üö∏
A sea of stranger&amp;rsquo;s faces watching your every move. Unfamiliar smells in the hallway.
Every chair is uncomfortable and makes weird noises when you sit.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re learning how to paint. When you look at the famous paintings at the museum, you might start asking yourself:
&amp;ldquo;Will I ever be this good? Is this for me? Will I ever understand all of this?&amp;rdquo;
If these questions sound familiar, it&amp;rsquo;s because you&amp;rsquo;re not alone. It&amp;rsquo;s not just you.
Believe it or not, the same questions can be applied to coding. Some things, like painting and learning how to code, are hard.</description>

      <title>How to write Badass READMES for your Github projects</title>

      <guid>https://www.hexdevs.com/posts/github-readme-examples-and-template/</guid>
      <description>You show your GitHub project to people but they don&amp;rsquo;t understand what the code is about. Why should you take time to write a good README if they can simply &amp;ldquo;read the code&amp;rdquo;?
They won&amp;rsquo;t even look at your code if you don&amp;rsquo;t explain what&amp;rsquo;s in it for them. Why should anyone care about it?
What about making them curious about your project? It saves them time, it shows you care about good communication and that by writing good docs you probably write good code as well.</description>

      <description>When you get stuck, it‚Äôs really easy to block yourself from creatively solving your problem.
You start asking &amp;ldquo;why am I so dumb?&amp;rdquo;, or thinking that you don‚Äôt have a programmer&amp;rsquo;s brain, or feeling that you‚Äôll never understand anything.
How is that helpful? It isn‚Äôt.
The way we talk to each other (even to ourselves) impacts our performance. It‚Äôs not self-help BS. It‚Äôs how our brain works.</description>

Worse: you do an amazing interview, people loved you. But then they say they are moving forward with someone else that has more experience.

      <description>You have a technical blog but there is only one problem: no one is reading what you write.
Why?
Think about it: readers aren&amp;rsquo;t going through their day waiting for your tech tutorials. They&amp;rsquo;re busy dealing with whatever is going on in their day, just like you! They are thinking of how they are going finish their work before Friday, how they are going to fix the bug in production&amp;hellip; you get the picture.</description>

      <description>All those amazing tech talks sitting on your Watch Later list. Sounds more like a Never Watch list, right? ‚åõü§≠ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è So many great tech talks to learn from but you simply can&amp;rsquo;t find the time to watch them.
Plus, you get distracted and have to rewind the video several times. A 30 minutes talk easily turns into a 45 minutes one!
What if you had a time every month to sit down and watch a great tech talk with friends?</description>

      <description>We had a great time chatting with Preetam Nath and Sankalp Jonna, the co-founders of SuperLemon and DelightChat.
They started a micro-SaaS in 2019. After about 14 months, they grew the monthly recurring revenue to $30,000. More than 20,000 merchants are using their product on the Shopify App Store, which is completely insane!
DelightChat is a customer support tool for small and medium-sized e-commerces.
The great thing about their story is that they&amp;rsquo;re not just building a business, but building a life on top of that business.</description>

How much of JS do you need to learn if you just want to write minimal code in JS?</description>
