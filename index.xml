      <description>This article is the second part of the Science of Expertise series. Before reading along, read The Science of Expertise: introduction to Perceptual Learning. the resources mentioned in this series is also found at the end.
A Better Way to Practice Ruby: Deliberate Practice Perceptual Learning results are promising.
Unfortunately, no research has been made for programming yet. In this article, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn what we apply from what&amp;rsquo;s been published regarding Perceptual Learning in several domains.</description>

      <description>How do you become an expert? Why some Ruby developers can&amp;rsquo;t explain what they know? Why some developers don&amp;rsquo;t develop expert skills? What does it mean to be a Ruby expert?
To discuss these questions, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore Perceptual Learning (PL) research.
PL is a natural learning process that complements traditional Education. It accelerates expertise by speeding pattern recognition, intuition and fluency on a given subject.
Ever since I found out about Perceptual Learning in the book &amp;ldquo;Badass - Making users awesome&amp;rdquo;, from Kathy Sierra, I got really curious to learn more about the science behind Perceptual Learning.</description>

      <title>How to Improve Code Quality on a Ruby on Rails Application</title>
      <link>https://www.hexdevs.com/posts/code-quality-ruby-on-rails/</link>

      <guid>https://www.hexdevs.com/posts/code-quality-ruby-on-rails/</guid>
      <description>Does it take forever to ship even small features on the codebase you&amp;rsquo;re working on? Is the code hard to understand and maintain? Are projects always running over budget? Are you constantly sacrificing code quality and not paying down technical debt?
When you change one feature, does another completely unrelated part of your app stop working? New bugs appear, even though tests never break? 🥵
Those are signs that you are suffering from working on a codebase with low code quality.</description>

      <description>Are you looking for courses, training, and resources to improve your Ruby and Ruby on Rails skills, but you are not being paid in US dollars?
Most Ruby and Ruby on Rails books and courses are priced in US dollars. When you can&amp;rsquo;t afford them just because the country you live in has an undervalued currency compared to the dollar, it makes it difficult to invest in your education.
There are many free options you probably already know about, and you&amp;rsquo;re already using them.</description>

      <description>You want to write smooth professional-looking code.
You&amp;rsquo;re craving some squeaky-clean code. But all you have for lunch every day is a big bowl of legacy spaghetti code.
You consider yourself a decent developer, but you&amp;rsquo;re never sure how to organize a project. How to name things. Where some piece of business logic should live.
How can you become a Ruby on Rails expert if the code you read every day stinks?</description>

      <title>New job, new codebase. How do you even get started?</title>

      <description>One of my readers asked:
 How do you get started when you join a new company? How do you add features to a codebase that is massive, scary, and completely new to you?
 The first day at your new developer job is just like the first day at a new school. 🚸
A sea of stranger&amp;rsquo;s faces watching your every move. Unfamiliar smells in the hallway.
Every chair is uncomfortable and makes weird noises when you sit.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re learning how to paint. When you look at the famous paintings at the museum, you might start asking yourself:
&amp;ldquo;Will I ever be this good? Is this for me? Will I ever understand all of this?&amp;rdquo;
If these questions sound familiar, it&amp;rsquo;s because you&amp;rsquo;re not alone. It&amp;rsquo;s not just you.
Believe it or not, the same questions can be applied to coding. Some things, like painting and learning how to code, are hard.</description>

      <title>How to write Badass READMES for your Github projects</title>
      <link>https://www.hexdevs.com/posts/github-readme-examples-and-template/</link>

      <guid>https://www.hexdevs.com/posts/github-readme-examples-and-template/</guid>
      <description>You show your GitHub project to people but they don&amp;rsquo;t understand what the code is about. Why should you take time to write a good README if they can simply &amp;ldquo;read the code&amp;rdquo;?
They won&amp;rsquo;t even look at your code if you don&amp;rsquo;t explain what&amp;rsquo;s in it for them. Why should anyone care about it?
What about making them curious about your project? It saves them time, it shows you care about good communication and that by writing good docs you probably write good code as well.</description>

      <description>When you get stuck, it’s really easy to block yourself from creatively solving your problem.
You start asking &amp;ldquo;why am I so dumb?&amp;rdquo;, or thinking that you don’t have a programmer&amp;rsquo;s brain, or feeling that you’ll never understand anything.
How is that helpful? It isn’t.
The way we talk to each other (even to ourselves) impacts our performance. It’s not self-help BS. It’s how our brain works.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re focusing on finding that first Ruby job. You&amp;rsquo;ve been practicing for months or years. You&amp;rsquo;ve been applying to entry-level jobs, even internships.
You polish your resume. Tweak your portfolio. Attach your CV. Press Submit.
Chirp, chirp, chirp 🦗
Nothing happens.
Worse: you do an amazing interview, people loved you. But then they say they are moving forward with someone else that has more experience.
Welp, next time is going to be different.</description>

      <description>You have a technical blog but there is only one problem: no one is reading what you write.
Why?
Think about it: readers aren&amp;rsquo;t going through their day waiting for your tech tutorials. They&amp;rsquo;re busy dealing with whatever is going on in their day, just like you! They are thinking of how they are going finish their work before Friday, how they are going to fix the bug in production&amp;hellip; you get the picture.</description>

      <description>We had a great time chatting with Preetam Nath and Sankalp Jonna, the co-founders of SuperLemon and DelightChat.
They started a micro-SaaS in 2019. After about 14 months, they grew the monthly recurring revenue to $30,000. More than 20,000 merchants are using their product on the Shopify App Store, which is completely insane!
DelightChat is a customer support tool for small and medium-sized e-commerces.
The great thing about their story is that they&amp;rsquo;re not just building a business, but building a life on top of that business.</description>
