What score would you get?\nHere‚Äôs the catch: how you think you‚Äôre doing and what your teammates think how you‚Äôre doing are not the same thing.\nWant to find out for sure whether you‚Äôre moving up the Engineering Ladder anytime soon or not? The only way is by asking for instructive feedback.\nFeedback is a thermometer for job satisfaction, and consequently, a promotion. Want to know how long you‚Äôre going to stay happy and productive at your current job? Calculate how often you receive instructive feedback:\n In my study of over 20,000 people across industries and organizations with Tony Schwartz, we found that higher levels of feedback are associated with 89% greater thriving at work, 63% more engagement, and 79% higher job satisfaction. People who receive more feedback are also 1.2 times more likely to stay with the organization ‚Äì Nine Tips for Giving Better Feedback at Work\n You want to gather data to shed light on your performance: are you doing enough ‚Äúpromotable‚Äù work? Are the expectations for your role being met? Do you and your manager agree on what those expectations are? Is your team‚Äôs work aligned with the company‚Äôs goals?\nFeedback is not advice: make sure you know exactly what you‚Äôre asking for Most questions we ask our managers are transactional: we want something from them. But what if you asked questions that helped you connect with them while standing out from the crowd?\nThe following questions are based on the book ‚ÄúJust Listen: Discover the Secret to Getting Through to Absolutely Anyone‚Äù by Mark Goulston. They are perfect for when you want to understand the big picture of the business and your place in it.\nUse these guided prompts to stand out. When doing 1:1s about your career goals and performance, ask:\n I‚Äôd like you to imagine it‚Äôs a year from now, and you and your bosses are reviewing a Developer you‚Äôve hired this year ‚Äî and when it comes to this position, they say, ‚ÄòGet us more developers like that one. That person was one of the best hires we‚Äôve had in a long time.‚Äô Can you tell me what this Developer did to get such a rave review? If you could change one thing about the direction of the company, what would it be? If there is one thing I can do to help you move more quickly towards your goals here in the company, what would it be? What‚Äôs the one thing you‚Äôre the proudest of accomplishing? To make sure I‚Äôm on the right track ‚Äî what are the three things you‚Äôd like me to always do, and three things you‚Äôd like me to never do. I‚Äôve heard from many managers that, on a development team, there are always more things to worry about, more things to fix than time and energy available. Do you feel like we‚Äôre on the right track?  You‚Äôll both leave this meeting with a sense of direction. Now you know what you haven‚Äôt been paying attention to. And how you can fix it. You‚Äôll know exactly the things you‚Äôre doing well, and how you can increase your positive impact on the team.\nAsk these questions, and listen closely. You will leave the meeting with a 100% chance of impressing your manager. And you‚Äôll be ready to impress your team next.\nInstead of just saying ‚Äúhey, can I be a Senior developer now?‚Äù, asking for instructive feedback is the first step to getting there. By asking these questions, one of our Get to Senior students completely changed her idea about what she needed to do to get to Senior level. Here‚Äôs how the course helped her:\n ‚ÄúI‚Äôve spoken with my manager about what I could do better and what could be my gaps and learned what they expect from me. Turns out I need experience leading projects and there will be plenty of opportunities to do that in the near future. Now I know what to focus on and it is not what I thought it would be. I‚Äôm happy with the outcome.‚Äù ‚Äì Caroline Salib‚Äã, Software Developer @ Shopify\n Now, instead of asking for random advice from random people, ask for feedback directly from the person who has lots of context about your knowledge gaps and how you can be promoted. And you can start identifying golden problems you can solve and projects you can lead to expanding the impact of your work.\nBetter than having no idea where to start.\nBetter than constantly feeling overwhelmed.\nBetter than trying to learn everything other people say a Senior Ruby Developer should know ü§∑\nNow, book a 1:1 with your manager and use these questions above as a script üìÖ Opportunities are not given. They are created. By asking for feedback, you‚Äôll have the confidence to take the next step that is right for YOU.\nYou got this! üí™\n  Did you like this article?
