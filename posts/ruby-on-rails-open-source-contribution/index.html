Make meaningful connections with the community? Learn the best practices on how to maintain a large codebase?\nWhat if you could get that experience by contributing to an open source project like Ruby on Rails?\nIf that sounds scary, don‚Äôt worry! We can help you!\nBy the end of this post, you‚Äôll learn 5 ways to become a new Rails contributor, even if you are a beginner in Ruby. Plus, you will find answers to the some questions you probably have.\nAre you ready? Let‚Äôs go!\n5 ways to contribute to Ruby on Rails as a beginner 1 - Find issues labeled as ‚Äúgood first issue‚Äù These are labeled as Good First Issue. There‚Äôs not a lot of them and they can get closed pretty fast! They might not be simple for beginners in Rails. Note that you can always ask for help in the issue comments or in the Rails forum.\n2 - Pick an issue labeled as ‚ÄúWith reproduction steps‚Äù Issues labeled as With reproduction steps candidates because you have a way to check that the bug really exists. You can fix the bug and use the reproduction steps to check your work.\nBy following this method, we were able to get our second PR merged. It works!\nWhat if the issue cannot be reproduced? Sometimes, the issue cannot be reproduced by other people. If you‚Äôre able to confirm it, explain why and let the maintainers know. That‚Äôs another great way to contribute to the project, as it may show that it‚Äôs not a bug on the Ruby on Rails codebase, but something unrelated.\nTo give you an example, one of our readers (Aish) found out that this issue could not be reproduced, created a video, and shared this information as a comment on the issue. This contribution helped the maintainers close it.\n3 - Fix the bugs you find yourself (‚Äúyour bug‚Äù) When you‚Äôre working on a Ruby on Rails app, you might run into a framework bug. That‚Äôs good, now you can fix the bug yourself! This can happen when you‚Äôre using the latest version of the framework, or using one of its newer features.\n4 - Add reproduction steps to new issues You can pick an issue that does not have reproduction steps. Try to understand what‚Äôs going on, and then add the reproduction steps yourself. This way, you can help the Rails core team by checking if a new issue is valid. Great way to build your debugging skills!\n5 - I‚Äôm ready to contribute to Ruby on Rails! You can always pick any open issue (that no one else is working on) and try to figure things out as you go. That‚Äôs cool too! Just pick one and get to work.

Question: [at 8:13] Would love to get started contributing to the Rails project but I don‚Äôt know how. How should I do it?\nDon‚Äôt know how to suggest a new feature? Open an issue in the Rails repository or post a topic on the Rails forum? Question: [at 19:23] If I want to suggest a feature, should I open an issue in the Rails repository or post a topic on the Rails forum?\nHow can we get feedback on ongoing issues and Pull Requests more quickly? Question: [at 54:58] Often getting a response for a contribution takes weeks. How can we effectively get feedback on ongoing issues or Pull Requests?\nRails is maintained by volunteers and most of them work on it during their free time. So it might take some time. Ask or comment on the issue or PR to get an answer.\nIf it‚Äôs a Pull Request, you can post the link on Rails Forum to bring attention.\nBefore you ask for feedback or code reviews, it‚Äôs a good idea to make sure that:\n tests are passing documentation is updated if it‚Äôs an bug/issue, can you try to fix it yourself? if you don‚Äôt know how to fix the code, can you write a Reproduction Script or create Reproduction Steps? make it easier for people to accept your PR: give them the code, Reproduction Steps, that the code consists of a small number of code changes explain and add details so reviewers can understand the impact of your changes: does it affect all Rails applications or only some of them?  The whole point is to make it easier for reviewers to accept your changes.\nIssues and PRs that follow these guidelines grab more attention than the ones that don‚Äôt have a lot of feedback, no comments, tests are broken, and the Rails team doesn‚Äôt know if the concept is good or not.\nWhich part of the Ruby on Rails project is the best for a beginner to get started with? Changing the Rails Guides or Documentation, Active Record, or something else? Question: [at 59:15] Which part of the project should I work on first: Rails Guides \u0026 Documentation, Active Record, Action Mailer, or something else?\nWhat if there is someone else already working on the issue? Question: [at 1:04:36] How can I know if there is someone else already working on the issue, and what should I do if that happens?\nHow do you know if you should run all tests or just some of them?

How can we effectively get feedback on ongoing issues or Pull Requests?</em></p><p>Rails is maintained by volunteers and most of them work on it during their free time. So it might take some time. Ask or comment on the issue or PR to get an answer.</p><p>If it&rsquo;s a Pull Request, you can post the link on <a href=https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/>Rails Forum</a> to bring attention.</p><p>Before you ask for feedback or code reviews, it&rsquo;s a good idea to make sure that:</p><ul><li>tests are passing</li><li>documentation is updated</li><li>if it&rsquo;s an bug/issue, can you try to fix it yourself?</li><li>if you don&rsquo;t know how to fix the code, can you write a Reproduction Script or create Reproduction Steps?</li><li>make it easier for people to accept your PR: give them the code, Reproduction Steps, that the code consists of a small number of code changes</li><li>explain and add details so reviewers can understand the impact of your changes: does it affect all Rails applications or only some of them?</li></ul><p>The whole point is to make it easier for reviewers to accept your changes.</p><p>Issues and PRs that follow these guidelines grab more attention than the ones that don&rsquo;t have a lot of feedback, no comments, tests are broken, and the Rails team doesn&rsquo;t know if the concept is good or not.</p><h3 id=which-part-of-the-ruby-on-rails-project-is-the-best-for-a-beginner-to-get-started-with-changing-the-rails-guides-or-documentation-active-record-or-something-else>Which part of the Ruby on Rails project is the best for a beginner to get started with?
