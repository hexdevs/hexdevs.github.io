      <description>Imagine spending months under the Arctic in a submarine several meters below the ice.
Or just watch this interesting video from Getting Smarter Every Day to have an idea.

It&amp;rsquo;s a high-risk environment and even a tiny issue can have catastrophic consequences.</description>

      <description>If you’ve been following us for a while, you know we are super passionate about FIRE/financial independence.
Five years ago, we didn&amp;rsquo;t even know where our money was going. Our dream of moving abroad felt so far away: we didn&amp;rsquo;t have any money. But we knew we had to do something about it!
