      <description>In the previous episode, I shared why I decided to choose an audience that I belong to: Rails Developers. Recently, I took a small detour from my 30x500 journey. This detour is what I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking more about on this episode!
Let&amp;rsquo;s go!

      <description>Welcome to the 3rd episode of Dev to Founder!
In the latest episode, I forgot to share a huge milestone to me. As you may remember, I was doing CBT - Cognitive Behavior Therapy sessions. My therapist said I don&amp;rsquo;t need regular sessions anymore! This is big news and it&amp;rsquo;s incredible to see how much I learned with those sessions.
I still have lots of automatic negative thoughts but trust me, having the techniques that help me handle them on my own is priceless.</description>

      <description>We had a great time chatting with Preetam Nath and Sankalp Jonna, the co-founders of SuperLemon and DelightChat.
They started a micro-SaaS in 2019. After about 14 months, they grew the monthly recurring revenue to $30,000. More than 20,000 merchants are using their product on the Shopify App Store, which is completely insane!
DelightChat is a customer support tool for small and medium-sized e-commerces.
The great thing about their story is that they&amp;rsquo;re not just building a business, but building a life on top of that business.</description>

      <title>Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters</title>

      <description>About Shape Up Shape Up is an agile product development approach used internally by Basecamp. It has three distinct phases:
 Shaping  The product strategy team writes a pitch that describes the problem that needs to be solved, giving as much detail as needed, and proposes a solution. The level of detail should be specific enough so that the team working on the project knows what to do. It should also leave enough room so the team can figure out the best way to build a solution that fits scope and budget constraints.</description>

      <description>If youâ€™ve been following us for a while, you know we are super passionate about FIRE/financial independence.
Five years ago, we didn&amp;rsquo;t even know where our money was going. Our dream of moving abroad felt so far away: we didn&amp;rsquo;t have any money. But we knew we had to do something about it!
We made a promise: that we would never have problems with money anymore.
We started budgeting, investing, and growing our net worth.</description>
