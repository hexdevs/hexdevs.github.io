A guide to planning for your financial independence so you can retire early, or build your runway to go full-time on your products, sooner!\nToday‚Äôs episode is going to be about sticking to the original plan.\nCourse-correction Although I loved shipping Spark your Runway with FIRE, I ended slipping away from my big goal. As you may know, I‚Äôve enrolled in the 30x500 Bootcamp by Stacking the Bricks.\nI ended up skipping my lessons and was spending most of my time on something that I didn‚Äôt do any research.\nLast week I was feeling anxious. Talking to my husband and using the tools my Therapist gave me to deal with these situations, I concluded that I was trying to do too much at the same time.\nOf course, I felt anxious! I was attempting to do lots of things.\nBut I‚Äôm not here to complain! Let me share some insights with you so you can at least take something from this episode.\nHere‚Äôs what I did to help me manage this anxiety and get back on track. It‚Äôs been working better than I imagined!\n I created a list called ‚ÄúMy current tasks‚Äù. I added everything I thought I needed to do, things I‚Äôve promised to others, things I should be doing, etc. The other list I created was the ‚ÄúShining New Ideas‚Äù. The name is self-explanatory. It‚Äôs simple yet powerful. To calm my brain down, I add new ideas there but don‚Äôt take any action. Getting them out of my head is a blessing.  Here‚Äôs what I got after this exercise. I had thirteen tasks on the ‚ÄúMy Current tasks‚Äù list and one on the ‚ÄúShining New ideas‚Äù list.\n13 tasks! Three of them were unnecessary. Four of them I finished in 1 hour, two of them I marked as things that can be done in the future.\nSomething that surprised me was how powerful the Shining New Ideas list is. I add an item almost every day but it doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going to give more attention to them now.\nBefore, I would start planning for any new idea right away. Now, I will only look at them again after I‚Äôve finished what I‚Äôve committed to do.\nYou see, our brains trick us into thinking that we need to do everything. At the same time! This is impossible and unproductive. Not to mention that your brain will criticize you when you don‚Äôt finish at least one of them.\nNext time you‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed or can‚Äôt keep up with your goals, stop for a moment. Take a step back. Course-correct.\nUnderstanding why we behave as we do and how to make our brain our biggest ally is a crucial skill for the modern days.\nWhat‚Äôs next Yes, you guessed it! Focus on 30x500 again, I‚Äôm about 59% of the first module right now. I‚Äôm on track to finishing it 7 weeks from now and start building a business, one win at a time.\nGood decisions come from experience. Experience comes from making bad decisions. Mark Twain That‚Äôs it for today! I hope you can learn something from your experience this week!\nDon‚Äôt forget to rate the show, so more people can find us.
