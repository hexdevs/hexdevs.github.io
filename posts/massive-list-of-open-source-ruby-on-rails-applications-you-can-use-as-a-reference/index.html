In this post, I‚Äôm going to show you how to install it. And how to use it for implementing some of the most common things you need as a Ruby on Rails Developer.\nA Massive List of Open-Source Ruby on Rails Application Examples Want to follow along? Watch the video below to see how to browse real-world-rails and find answers to your questions:\n  \nHow to Install real-world-rails git clone git@github.com:eliotsykes/real-world-rails.git cd real-world-rails/ bundle install I‚Äôm using ripgrep to recursively search for code. It‚Äôs super fast. Click here to learn how to install it. Or use your favorite grep tool.\nYou can also add ripgrep as the default search tool for your editor (I use it with Emacs).\nInit submodules Remove broken submodules\nAs I am writing this post, three submodules are not public anymore and will cause an error when pulled. The easiest way to fix this is to just remove them:\ngit rm engines/o_cms git rm apps/shoppe git rm apps/netguru-help Then, init the submodules to have access to all linked repositories (on /apps and /engines folders):\ngit submodule update --init --jobs 4 This command will take some time because it will pull about 8 GB of code üíæ (TIP: You can probably get around this by doing a git shallow clone and save some disk space!)\nAfter you have pulled the submodules, you‚Äôll be ready to go. It‚Äôs time to move on to the fun part!\nHow to Find Examples of Ruby on Rails Projects Exploring these different open source apps and engines will teach you a lot about how other people write professional code.\nThe maintainers added a bunch of cool examples of things you can search for and commands you can run.\nIf you want some more examples and other ideas of things you can search for and learn from, keep reading!\nList All Ruby on Rails Models To see a list of basic Ruby on Rails models, run:\nrg --type ruby -C 5 'You‚Äôll get all models that inherit from ApplicationRecord directly, which means most of them.\nHow to Write Ruby method definitions To find examples of how to write method definitions, just search for it. In this example, we‚Äôre searching for any class that defines a method related to email:\nrg -truby 'def email' Similarly, you can search for class methods that start with email...:\nrg -truby 'def self.email' Other fun examples Some days ago I wanted to see how and why people create classes that inherit from Hash. What kind of things do they want to accomplish? And how to properly override Hash methods if you want to extend the class. Here‚Äôs how I answered my own questions.\nFirst, I searched for classes who inherited from Hash:\nrg -truby -C 5 'Then I wanted to see how people override some basic hash methods, such as Hash#[] and Hash#[]=:\nrg --type ruby -C 20 'Here‚Äôs the result:\n  Which allowed me to answer my question and satisfy my curiosity.\nHow to Write Service Classes A common question that developers ask is this: ‚Äúhow should I write Service Classes?‚Äù Well, just take a look at lots of examples and see how you like them.\nWant to find examples of how to write Ruby on Rails Service Classes? This will give you a bunch of examples and the first few lines of each class:\nrg --type ruby -C 5 'class [A-Za-z]+Service' Here‚Äôs the result:\n  How to Write Job Classes Want to find examples of how people write Ruby on Rails Job Classes? How often jobs should be retried, how many attempts to set, and how to handle errors?\nRun this:\nrg --type ruby -C 5 'class [A-Za-z]+Job' And you will see something like this:\n  How to Write Worker Classes Same idea: want to find examples of how to write Ruby Worker Classes? Run:\nrg -truby -C 10 'class .*Worker$' And this is what you‚Äôll see:\n  How To Structure Large Ruby on Rails Applications Look at very large Ruby on Rails applications such as Gitlab (and others) and see how they do it. You don‚Äôt need to do the same thing they are doing, as they have different goals and contexts.\nBut you can look at these different apps and form your own opinion. Adapt their ideas and make them work for you. That way, you don‚Äôt have to come up with a new approach totally from scratch.\nHere are a couple of things you might want to explore.\n  How to Structure the Models Folder When you Have Inheritance and Multiple Levels of Hierarchies When you are not structuring your Ruby on Rails project strictly following the plain old MVC pattern, it‚Äôs a good idea to look at how other people organize their code.\nThis is useful when you are doing Domain Driven Design, or have some complex models with inheritance and complicated hierarchies, nested modules, and things like that.\nTake a look at the directory structure of some large Ruby on Rails Applications. Here‚Äôs an example:\ntree apps/gitlabhq/app/models And you should be able to see the directory structure of the models folder:\n  How to See Examples of Complex Ruby on Rails Features Gitlab has an interesting worker that imports repositories from different sources, including GitHub.\nWant to know how Gitlab imports a repository from GitHub? Take a look at the code:\nrg -truby 'GithubImport' Here is how you can see the folder structure:\ntree apps/gitlabhq/app/workers/gitlab/github_import This is what you‚Äôll see:\n  Then open the files/folders with vim, Emacs, VSCode, or your favorite editor.\n Really cool, right?\nExplore, read, and form your own opinions about other people‚Äôs code. The more you get exposed to professional code, the more you can build your ‚Äúcoding taste‚Äù and expertise.\nNext time you need examples or inspiration for a feature, and you‚Äôre not sure how to implement it, use this resource as a guide. Bookmark this post for later reference ‚≠ê\nBy the way, this post was inspired by my Twitter thread:\nüí°Rails tip: not sure how to implement a feature, a migration, a model, a spec, etc.?\nBrowse `real-world-rails` and see how others have done it. It's a huge list of open-source Rails applications.\n‚Äî Thiago Araujo (@thdaraujo) February 22, 2022  \nI did not expect it to gather so much interest.
