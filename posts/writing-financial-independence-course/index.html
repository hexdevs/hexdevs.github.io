We started budgeting, investing, and growing our net worth. A couple of years later, we moved to the beautiful city of Vancouver - Canada. Along the way, we decided that we wanted to achieve financial independence as soon as possible.\nWhat is Financial Independence? Short and sweet, it’s when your investment returns cover all your expenses.\nIn other words, you only need to work if you want to. You maximize your savings to build a nest of investments large enough to pay for your expenses for many years, possibly forever.\n As a developer, optimization is something that you do every day. Why not optimize your finances?\n The compound growth of your everyday actions will allow you to live your life the way YOU want.\nPursuing financial independence is also a fast track to personal growth. We’ve been on this journey for a while and we’ve learned a lot about ourselves, and the things that matter the most to us. It’s a path to freedom, meaning, and control over our lives.\nIf you ever thought about leaving your job, embarking on an entrepreneurship journey, or building something new, then being financially independent will give you space and the time to try things out without worrying about money.\nWhenever I tell someone that we are on a path to financial independence, it raises curiosity. People ask us about our lifestyle, investments, and how to get started.\nPeople think that they need to know everything about investments. They think they need to have a huge amount of money to be even able to start. Spoiler alert: that’s not true.\nIt’s normal to get scared about doing fundamental changes to your life. And some of the content out there about FIRE is not very approachable. If you’re reading/thinking about it, it might look overwhelming or too aggressive.\nBut I can guarantee that anyone can do it. Chances are, as someone that works in the Tech Industry, you’re probably making more money than the majority of people. That means you can achieve financial independence very quickly.\nThat’s why I want to write more about it, and I want to make it more approachable to software developers. Also, writing from a developer’s perspective is more fun.\nIf you’re up to the challenge, you’re going to learn a lot about yourself and what matters to you during the process . You will build the power to buy your freedom. The sooner you start, the sooner you’ll have control over your life. Why not start now?\nI am writing an e-book to help you get started on your journey to Financial Independence.\nHere is what I am going to cover:\n What is FIRE, what are the options available? Answer the most common questions we get Tips on how to optimize time and save more money How to figure out what matters to you? Share stories of tech people that achieved financial independence (there are lots of them!)  The best thing I can do now is to motivate you by showing that financial independence is possible. It’s the greatest thing you could be doing for yourself!\nWhat do you think? Does that sound like an interesting topic?\nFeel free to ping me if you want to learn more about a specific topic, I’d be happy to share some tips!\nAnd stay tuned for updates in the next couple of weeks.\n","wordCount":"627","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-10-31T14:21:59-07:00","dateModified":"2020-10-31T14:21:59-07:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Thiago Araujo"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.hexdevs.com/posts/writing-financial-independence-course/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"hexdevs","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.hexdevs.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=single id=top><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else{if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}}</script><noscript><style type=text/css>.theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><p class=logo><a href=https://www.hexdevs.com/>hexdevs</a>
