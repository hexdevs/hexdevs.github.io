Your posts are perfect. You are a smart person and you want to show your developer expertise.\nThere is only one problem: no one is reading what you write.\nWhy?\nDo you want to know the answer? It‚Äôs going to hurt.\nHere it goes:\n‚ÄúNo one cares about you.\" üòÆ\nIt sucks, right? Hold on. Let‚Äôs take a deep breath. it‚Äôs true and it‚Äôs not a bad thing.\nWe do care about you and we‚Äôre going to help you.\nFirst, let‚Äôs understand why the way you write is not effective. This post is a summary of the video of the class ‚ÄúThe Craft of Writing Effectively‚Äù by Larry McEnerney, from the University of Chicago‚Äôs Writing Program.\nWhy it‚Äôs hard to write effectively What do you do when you find a text hard to understand or not relevant to you?\nFirst, you slow down. You re-read sentences or entire paragraphs. You get confused and frustrated. If you need to continue reading the text because you need the information, you keep reading. Otherwise, you give up.\nThat‚Äôs probably what is happening in the reader‚Äôs mind that gets to your blog.\nThe lesson ‚ÄúThe Craft of Writing Effectively‚Äù is targeted at academic experts who can‚Äôt get their papers accepted, but the gems of this class apply to everyone who writes.\nProfessor Larry says that we write for two main reasons: first, to help us think. Especially when we work with complex things, writing helps with our thinking.\nThe second main use of writing is to change the way readers see the world.\nWhen you write for someone else to read, you have to stop thinking about rules and start thinking about readers. Your writing is not to communicate anything about you; it‚Äôs to change the way your readers think.\nAccording to Larry, schools and universities train us to write essays. The problem is that these essays are evaluated under rule-governed training, for example, texts need to be clear, concise, persuasive, etc.\nContent can be clear, new, original, and still be useless! Rules don‚Äôt matter if the context is irrelevant.\nWe learned to write to show that know what we‚Äôre talking about. That we have the required knowledge for passing the assignments. That‚Äôs why we always try to explain things especially when someone says they don‚Äôt understand what we wrote.\nWhy did teachers read your papers? Have you ever asked yourself this question?\n Because institutions paid them to care about us. It was their job. This stopped the moment we left school. We all have learned to write in a system where we are writing to readers that are paid to care about us.\n Then, Larry says our favorite quote of the class, which is ‚Äúyou have been trained for years to write garbage‚Äù! It sucks.\nIn real life, readers are more interested in solving their problems or being entertained. Have you ever stopped reading something just because it had typos or because the style was not ‚Äúconventionally or grammatically correct?‚Äù\nNo, you read it because it‚Äôs relevant to you. In other words, you pay with your time and attention, which are precious skills these days.\n  How to learn how to write effectively   Start with a problem your readers have that you can help with. What makes it important? Why should they care? Does that inconsistency cost them anything? Persuasion depends on what they doubt and not on what you think is cool.\n  The introduction is a quick version of why they are wrong, according to you. Because you might have proven that your work is valuable to them, they will read your post.\n  Defining or explaining things is not necessary. You are writing to people who already know this stuff. Skip explaining things and adding background sections.\n  Every community has its code. Learn their code and rules. A code is a set of words that communicates value to a group. Create a word list with their code and use it in your writing. Without using their own words, you are very unlikely to create value or to be persuasive.\n   By definition, anything you write has the function to help your readers understand better something that they want to understand well.\n Top 3 Takeaways  Writing serves two main purposes. 1: to help you think. 2: to change your reader‚Äôs mind. For the second purpose, writing is not about the writer, it‚Äôs about the reader. What‚Äôs in it for them? Know your readers. What problems do they have that you can help with? Remember, no one cares about the inside of your head unless you pay them to. Study your readers. Learn their code and create a word list to use in your writing. What do they read? What do they share? The answers are in front of you, so pay close attention.  Homework Next time you‚Äôre reading something, try noticing why you continue reading it or why you stop. Pay attention to how the author writes and how they bring new ideas to you. Do you notice the words they use?\nIf you‚Äôre interested in contributing to an open-source project, for example, look at the merged Pull Requests. See how the contributors talk, ask for reviews and discuss the issue. Include their words in your contributions.\nWrap up It‚Äôs painful to know the truth but the truth will set you free, according to Jesus.\nYOu‚Äôre not alone. We also struggled with writing effectively. It‚Äôs so much better when you are writing to help someone, though. You get out of your head and someone can use your work.\nIf you enjoyed this post, share it with someone who wants to learn how to write effectively.\nNow, let‚Äôs write useful stuff!\nLinks  The Craft of Writing Effectively    ","wordCount":"971","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://www.hexdevs.com/images/posts/writing-effectively-tips.jpg","datePublished":"2021-07-10T18:37:16-07:00","dateModified":"2021-08-10T15:43:53-07:00","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Stefanni Brasil"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Thiago Araujo"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.hexdevs.com/posts/why-no-one-reads-your-blog/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"hexdevs","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.hexdevs.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><noscript><style type=text/css>.theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.hexdevs.com/ accesskey=h title="hexdevs (Alt + H)">hexdevs</a>
