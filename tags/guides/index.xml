      <description>Are you trying to debug a Ruby gem but not sure how? Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick way to debug any Ruby Project using Pry and Git Bisect.
When triaging some open issues on Faker, an open-source Ruby gem, I came across Issue #2482. I was able to reproduce the problem. Turns out the bug was already fixed by this PR, but version v2.20.0 was released before that.
I thought this would be a great opportunity to show you how I debugged this issue so you can learn some new tricks.</description>
