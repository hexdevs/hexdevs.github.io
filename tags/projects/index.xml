      <description>Hey, Stefanni here! ðŸ‘‹
I am happy to share that I&amp;rsquo;ve joined the 12xstartup.com challenge! Starting November 1st, and I wanted to share a few things with you:
Goal My main goal is to work consistently, get feedback, and learn how to solve problems.
I may not get to do 12 projects, but I will try my best. Maybe focusing on one project for 2 months or so, I don&amp;rsquo;t know yet.</description>

We made a promise: that we would never have problems with money anymore. We started budgeting, investing, and growing our net worth.</description>
