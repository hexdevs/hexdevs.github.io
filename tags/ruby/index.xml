      <description>What do lurking and flossing only one tooth have to do with contributing to Open Source? It&amp;rsquo;s all about starting small and sustaining tiny habits.
 Be a lurker and start small. Read a PR, try to understand what‚Äôs going on. Leave a thumbs up üëç if you like it. This is a very easy way to get started. And build a habit out of that. &amp;ndash; schneems

      <description>Are you trying to debug a Ruby gem but not sure how? Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick way to debug any Ruby Project using Pry and Git Bisect.
When triaging some open issues on Faker, an open-source Ruby gem, I came across Issue #2482. I was able to reproduce the problem. Turns out the bug was already fixed by this PR, but version v2.20.0 was released before that.
I thought this would be a great opportunity to show you how I debugged this issue so you can learn some new tricks.</description>

      <description>If you could run a career quality tool to analyze your progress, would it say you‚Äôre moving in the right direction? What score would you get?
Here‚Äôs the catch: how you think you‚Äôre doing and what your teammates think how you&amp;rsquo;re doing are not the same thing.
Want to find out for sure whether you‚Äôre moving up the Engineering Ladder anytime soon or not? The only way is by asking for instructive feedback.</description>

      <description>Often as developers, we believe we are supposed to know everything. Just figure everything by ourselves. As long as we get faster and better at coding, our careers will progress smoothly.
But if you ask around, you‚Äôll notice that most people are feeling technically stuck, despite years of experience. If you ask for career advice, people will throw you an endless list of complex technical skills to master.
That‚Äôs not what you‚Äôll find here.</description>

      <guid>https://www.hexdevs.com/posts/code-quality-ruby-on-rails/</guid>
      <description>Does it take forever to ship even small features on the codebase you&amp;rsquo;re working on? Is the code hard to understand and maintain? Are projects always running over budget? Are you constantly sacrificing code quality and not paying down technical debt?
When you change one feature, does another completely unrelated part of your app stop working? New bugs appear, even though tests never break? ü•µ
Those are signs that you are suffering from working on a codebase with low code quality.</description>

      <description>Are you looking for courses, training, and resources to improve your Ruby and Ruby on Rails skills, but you are not being paid in US dollars?
Most Ruby and Ruby on Rails books and courses are priced in US dollars. When you can&amp;rsquo;t afford them just because the country you live in has an undervalued currency compared to the dollar, it makes it difficult to invest in your education.
There are many free options you probably already know about, and you&amp;rsquo;re already using them.</description>

      <description>You want to write smooth professional-looking code.
You&amp;rsquo;re craving some squeaky-clean code. But all you have for lunch every day is a big bowl of legacy spaghetti code.
You consider yourself a decent developer, but you&amp;rsquo;re never sure how to organize a project. How to name things. Where some piece of business logic should live.
How can you become a Ruby on Rails expert if the code you read every day stinks?</description>

      <description>One of my readers asked:
 How do you get started when you join a new company? How do you add features to a codebase that is massive, scary, and completely new to you?
 The first day at your new developer job is just like the first day at a new school. üö∏
A sea of stranger&amp;rsquo;s faces watching your every move. Unfamiliar smells in the hallway.
Every chair is uncomfortable and makes weird noises when you sit.</description>

      <description>When you&amp;rsquo;re banging your head against the wall trying to fix a bug, the last thing you want is having to stop and learn how to use the debugging tool.
