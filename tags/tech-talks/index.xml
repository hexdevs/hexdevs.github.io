      <description>All those amazing tech talks sitting on your Watch Later list. Sounds more like a Never Watch list, right? ‚åõü§≠ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è So many great tech talks to learn from but you simply can&amp;rsquo;t find the time to watch them.
Plus, you get distracted and have to rewind the video several times. A 30 minutes talk easily turns into a 45 minutes one!
What if you had a time every month to sit down and watch a great tech talk with friends?</description>
