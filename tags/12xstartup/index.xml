      <description>Hey, Stefanni here! ðŸ‘‹
I am happy to share that I&amp;rsquo;ve joined the 12xstartup.com challenge! Starting November 1st, and I wanted to share a few things with you:
Goal My main goal is to work consistently, get feedback, and learn how to solve problems.
I may not get to do 12 projects, but I will try my best. I will also continue writing on The Plant-Based Diet Club and creating content for the hexdevs podcast/blog :)</description>

      <description>Welcome back to Dev to Founder!
In the first episode, I committed to sharing my Shopify market research findings and hopefully have chosen a problem to work on. Spoiler: I did not choose a problem yet but I have interesting data that will guide me into making this decision pretty soon!
Regarding The Plant-Based Diet Club, I am happy to share that the 5-Day Plant-based Diet Email Challenge is going to be launched this Saturday!</description>

      <description>What is Dev to Founder? 
Hey there!
I am Stefanni and Dev to Founder is a new project where I share my trajectory from being a developer to bootstrapping a business for the first time!
From never having sold anything online to getting my first paying customers.
Although I am sharing my lessons to help you with my experience, it&amp;rsquo;s also a public commitment to push myself to ship things.</description>
