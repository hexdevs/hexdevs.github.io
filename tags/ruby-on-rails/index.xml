      <description>What is the proper way to change data in a Rails application running in production?
You might be spending a lot of time asking yourself how to change data in production.
Should you run data and schema modifications in one database migration?
Should you run rake scripts in production to modify data?
Should you pick one of the many specialized data migration gems? And if so, which one?
Some people will tell you that changing data with a database migration is an anti-pattern and migrations should only contain DDL statements such as create/alter/drop tables, columns, or indexes.</description>
