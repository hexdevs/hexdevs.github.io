      <description>Everyone says delivering a technical talk is a great opportunity to connect with people, build your reputation, create opportunities to grow your career. Here at hexdevs, we even recommend people to just don&amp;rsquo;t go to meetups&amp;hellip; but to talk at meetups!

      <description>Do you suffer from Slack notification anxiety? On-call schedules and deadlines giving you nightmares? Are your teammates nitpicking your code during code review?

A sea of stranger&amp;rsquo;s faces watching your every move. Unfamiliar smells in the hallway.
Every chair is uncomfortable and makes weird noises when you sit.</description>
