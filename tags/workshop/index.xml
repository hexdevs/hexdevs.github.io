      <description>Have you been applying to jobs hoping to get your career to the next level, but getting rejected every time?
Are you afraid you&amp;rsquo;ll be stuck forever as an intermediate developer?
3 to 5 years of experience as a Ruby on Rails developer gotta be enough to eventually land a better job, right?
It seems the only thing you can do is to just keep applying for more jobs. And hope for the best.</description>
