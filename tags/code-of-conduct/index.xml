We expect members… Be kind to each other, and to yourself.
Create opportunities to collaborate with one another, and invite others to do so.
Take care of our space as if it’s your home (or better).
Leave spaces better than you found them.
Encourage others in their endeavors, and respect each other’s privacy.</description>
