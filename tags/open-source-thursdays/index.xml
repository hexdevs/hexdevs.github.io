      <description>What is Open Source Thursdays? Did you always want to contribute to Rails but can&amp;rsquo;t get past getting overwhelmed and scared when looking at a big project by yourself?
That&amp;rsquo;s how we felt! We thought, why not do it live so other people can join us?
Neither of us has done this before. The plan is to get there and do everything live, no preparing in advance. Just the real work.</description>
