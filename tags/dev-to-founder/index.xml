      <description>In the previous episode, I shared the details behind shipping Spark your Runway with FIRE. A guide to planning for your financial independence so you can retire early, or build your runway to go full-time on your products, sooner!
Today&amp;rsquo;s episode is going to be about sticking to the original plan.
Course-correction Although I loved shipping Spark your Runway with FIRE, I ended slipping away from my big goal. As you may know, I&amp;rsquo;ve enrolled in the 30x500 Bootcamp by Stacking the Bricks.</description>

      <description>In the previous episode, I shared why I decided to choose an audience that I belong to: Rails Developers. Recently, I took a small detour from my 30x500 journey. This detour is what I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking more about on this episode!
Let&amp;rsquo;s go!
Spark your Runway with FIRE Two weeks ago, I published a guide called Spark your Runway with FIRE! It&amp;rsquo;s a pay-what-you-want guide about building up your runway so you can go independent on your own products, sooner.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the 4th episode of Dev to Founder!
In the previous episode, I shared why I decided to choose an audience that I belong to. You can listen to the episode to learn more about this process.
My audience is Ruby Developers and I set the goal of doing Sales Safari/Painstorming sessions to explore what they need, want, and buy.
And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I did!
Painstorming my audience watering holes Watering holes is a a term from 30x500 and it&amp;rsquo;s where your audience hangs out online.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the 3rd episode of Dev to Founder!
In the latest episode, I forgot to share a huge milestone to me. As you may remember, I was doing CBT - Cognitive Behavior Therapy sessions. My therapist said I don&amp;rsquo;t need regular sessions anymore! This is big news and it&amp;rsquo;s incredible to see how much I learned with those sessions.
I still have lots of automatic negative thoughts but trust me, having the techniques that help me handle them on my own is priceless.</description>

In the first episode, I committed to sharing my Shopify market research findings and hopefully have chosen a problem to work on. Spoiler: I did not choose a problem yet but I have interesting data that will guide me into making this decision pretty soon!
Regarding The Plant-Based Diet Club, I am happy to share that the 5-Day Plant-based Diet Email Challenge is going to be launched this Saturday!</description>

      <description>What is Dev to Founder? 
Hey there!
I am Stefanni and Dev to Founder is a new project where I share my trajectory from being a developer to bootstrapping a business for the first time!
From never having sold anything online to getting my first paying customers.
Although I am sharing my lessons to help you with my experience, it&amp;rsquo;s also a public commitment to push myself to ship things.</description>
