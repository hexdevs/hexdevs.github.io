      <description>Welcome to the 3rd episode of Dev to Founder!
On the latest episode, I forgot to share a huge milestone to me. As you may remember, I was doing CBT - Cognitive Behavior Therapy sessions. My therapist said I don&amp;rsquo;t need regular sessions anymore! This is big news and it&amp;rsquo;s incredible to see how much I learned with those sessions.
I still have lots of automatic negative thoughts but trust me, having the techniques that help me handle them on my own is priceless.</description>

      <description>Welcome back to Dev to Founder!
In the first episode, I committed to sharing my Shopify market research findings and hopefully have chosen a problem to work on. Spoiler: I did not choose a problem yet but I have interesting data that will guide me into making this decision pretty soon!
Regarding The Plant-Based Diet Club, I am happy to share that the 5-Day Plant-based Diet Email Challenge is going to be launched this Saturday!</description>

      <description>What is Dev to Founder? 
Hey there!
I am Stefanni and Dev to Founder is a new project where I share my trajectory from being a developer to bootstrapping a business for the first time!
From never having sold anything online to getting my first paying customers.
Although I am sharing my lessons to help you with my experience, it&amp;rsquo;s also a public commitment to push myself to ship things.</description>
