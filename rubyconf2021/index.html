This talk was first presented at RubyConf2021.\nYou can find the slides and the resources mentioned in this talk below:\n Slides üñºÔ∏è Resources mentioned in this talk üìñ  Introduction I am Stefanni. Here at hexdevs, I research, design and develop programs to help you become an expert developer.\nEver since I found out about Perceptual Learning in the book ‚ÄúBadass - Making users awesome‚Äù, from Kathy Sierra, I got really curious to learn more about the science behind Perceptual Learning.\nI‚Äôve been doing lots of research on Perceptual Learning and its applications in Education in many domains.\nIn this talk, I‚Äôll share the hallmarks of the research I‚Äôve made with you.\nYou are going to learn:\n What does it mean to be an expert. What is Perceptual Learning (PL). How its techniques can accelerate expertise. PL techniques for Ruby developers.  Perceptual Learning Perceptual learning was an emerging field in the 1960s with the work of the psychologist Eleanor Gibson. Her work showed that Perceptual Learning consists of improvements in information extraction as a result of practice.\nPerceptual Learning is one of the most important components of learning and expertise.\nFor the past 2 decades, PL has become an area of concentrated focus in the cognitive and neural sciences because of its promising results on accelerating expertise.\nWait, Stefanni, what has programming to do with Perceptual Learning? Isn‚Äôt programming such a high-level cognitive task?\n Recent work indicates that PL is strongly involved even in very high-level cognitive domains, such as the learning and understanding of mathematics [‚Ä¶] Although this research area is relatively new, findings indicate that even short PL interventions can accelerate the fluent use of structures [‚Ä¶]\" ‚Äì Kellman, Massey \u0026 Son (2009).\n What is the relationship between PL and expertise? ‚ÄúPerceptual Learning underlies many, if not most, of the profound differences between experts and novices in any domain‚Äù says Kellman et al. (2008)\nWhen we talk about expertise, it doesn‚Äôt take too long until someone brings up the case of chess players.\nBecoming a chess expert is often mistaken by a mysterious explanation because chess players can‚Äôt explain how they know what they know. If you ask them to verbalize all the decisions they make, they won‚Äôt be able to give you too many details about what‚Äôs going on in their heads.\nSimilarly, elite athletes are trained to not have to think at all. In fact, if you ask a tennis player, or any athelete, to explain their decisions as they perform, they will try to become aware of their actions, and they will perform poorly as a result. Because they are no longer relying on their automatic pilot.\nHow fast and accurately you perform indicates how much an expert you are.\nThat‚Äôs why when you ask experts ‚Äúhow did you know that?‚Äù or ‚Äúcan you teach me what you know‚Äù, you often get disappointed with the responses you get. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just practice‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI just know it‚Äù.\nWhat does it mean to be an expert? Put simply, expertise can be defined as:\n Rapid, automatic pick-up of important patterns and relationships ‚Äì including relations that are quite abstract ‚Äì characterizes experts in many domains of human expertise. Experts tend to see at a glance what is relevant and what it is not. They tend to pick up relations that are invisible to novices and to extract information with low attentional load.\n In a paper entitled ‚ÄúPerceptual Learning Modules in Mathematics: Enhancing Student‚Äôs Pattern Recognition, Structure Extraction, and Fluency‚Äù (2010) gives us this comparison between novices and experts:\n  Some characteristics of novice and expert information extraction - Kellman et al. (2008)\n  Does that ring a bell? Do you remember the first time you wrote your first line of Ruby code?\nYou had to figure out so many things at once. You spent lots of time (more than you initially expected) solving syntax issues, trying to decode errors that you had any idea where they were coming from!\nIf that‚Äôs where you are right now, you‚Äôre doing great, my friend. Embrace discomfort! That‚Äôs expected. You‚Äôre a human being learning a complex subject!\n We don‚Äôt grow when we‚Äôre enjoying ourselves ‚Äì we learn best when we are challenged, struggling, and occasionally falling - Ron Friedman\n Your brain does not see what an expert sees, even though you are both presented with the same information.\nSo when you feel like you:\n just don‚Äôt know enough to figure out what‚Äôs going on. just need to reach the point where everything clicks. will never understand programming and Ruby.  It doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt have what it takes to be a ruby developer. it‚Äôs because you haven‚Äôt produced better pattern processing skills yet, and not because you don‚Äôt have a programming brain. There is no such thing.\nA brain is a brain and, and as modern neuroscience has been proving over and over again, your brain is more capable than you imagine!\nHow to develop pattern processing expert skills We do that by developing domain-specific changes in the extraction of information.\nAccording to Kellman \u0026 Massey (2013), with appropriate practice, the brain progressively configures information extraction in any domain to optimize task performance.\nPL produces a variety of effects that fall into two categories:\n Discovery: finding out what information is relevant to a domain or classification (information selection). As each new instance will differ from the previous ones, learning also includes ignoring irrelevant differences. Fluency: extracting information with greater ease, speed, or reduced cognitive load; changes in the efficiency of information extraction. More parallel processing and faster pickup of information.  For the sake of keeping this resource short, let‚Äôs see one example of PL training.\nFrom ‚ÄúPerceptual learning and the technology of expertise: Studies in fraction learning and algebra‚Äù, Kellman et al. (2008), focused on presenting the reasoning and problem solving with fractional quantities, and algebra.\nWe‚Äôll focus only on the fraction experiment.\nPerceptual Learning in Fractions The goal of this experiment was to help upper elementary and middle school students to recognize and discriminate different types of fraction problems, and their ability to map these structures across different formats (word problems, fraction strips, number sentences).\nAll students attended 9 classes about unit first fractions:\n  Examples of Unit and Non-unit Fractions\n  Once they were finished, they were divided into 3 groups:\n  Unit first - Unit First PL, then 7 more lessons on non-unit fractions after, followed by Mixed Unit PL training.\n  Mixed PL - 7 more lessons on non-unit fractions, followed by Mixed Unit PL training.\n  Control - 7 more lessons on non-unit fractions but no PL training.\n  The PL trials for the Mixed and Unit-First groups had 2 to 13 sessions of 30 minutes training each.\nExamples:\n      \nThe tests focused on the transfer of knowledge by knowing how to solve problems involving fractions and comparing fractional quantities, focusing on the patterns, instead of computing solutions.\nResults from pre-test, immediate post-test, and delayed post-test (9 weeks after):\n All the groups improved their performance in the post-test and delayed post-test. The two PLM groups outperformed the no-PLM Control group. The Mixed-Unit group retained significant learning gains after 9 weeks of training.    Results from the experiment.\n  The results show that:\n Presenting simple and complex examples together help the students develop a more comprehensive and relational way to solve problems using fractions. Lessons on identifying structural patterns, as opposed to focusing on solving problems, is effective in leading to a better understanding of fractions. Supplementing lessons with PLM training shows significant learning gains.   From a PL perspective, the mind is a pattern recognizer and not a container of information.\n PL and programming This all seems fascinating!\nUnfortunately, no research has been made for programming yet. Here‚Äôs what we can learn from what‚Äôs been published in several domains.\n  \nA Better Way to Practice Ruby: Deliberate Practice  We get started by asking: ‚ÄúWhat is the topic to be mastered? What is my goal with this exercise?‚Äù. Once you identify what skill are you working on, measure your performance by doing sets of deliberate practice. To help your brain picks up what matters, get exposure to a wide range of good examples, from simple to more complex scenarios.  To measure your performance, aim to achieve 95% reliability within one to three 45-90 minute practice sessions.\nIf you can‚Äôt get to that performance level, try breaking the task/skill into smaller sub-tasks/sub-skills until you get to something you can master within that time.\nLet‚Äôs see this example of Deliberate Practice from Badass, by Kathy Sierra.\nThe goal is to master command-line interaction with Ruby.\n Create and run programs that calculate and print values based on command-line args Modify one code example to use command-line args. Run. Run sample programs using command-line args.  Here‚Äôs another example.\nThe goal is to practice the map function with Ruby.\n Build a list of even numbers from 1 to 100 and filtering out multiples of 3 using the map function. Build a list of even numbers from 1 to 100 using the map function.  Perceptual Techniques for Ruby developers That felt like a class, right? Let‚Äôs see what else we can apply from PL research to become a Ruby expert:\n  Focus on deliberate practice: Not just practice, practice and practice! Remember: a critical component of accelerating pattern recognition and fluency is to get exposure to a wide range of good examples that embody the relevant structures that you are learning (not just one or two examples).\n  Master the basics: it‚Äôs better to know the basics well than have surface knowledge about a couple of things. The better you master the topics, the more you are freeing your cognitive capacity to focus on higher-level problems. If it still takes you lots of time and effort to complete a task or you are just following tutorials without understanding the goal, you won‚Äôt advance to the next level as much as you expect.\n  Go easy on your brain: It‚Äôs cognitively costly to master a topic. To be kind to your brain, take a break after each deliberate practice session.\n  Embrace getting stuck: when you reach the point of ‚ÄúI am super stuck, I suck!‚Äù there‚Äôs a lot of information for you to take action. You are probably trying to rush something, or missing a crucial step. Learning what you don‚Äôt know yet is not bad, it‚Äôs information! Ask yourself: what I am missing here? Asking open-ended questions that gets your brain picking up on clues is more actionable than announcing your defeat.\n  Always be sharpening your knife: experts are always identifying what skills they are not fluent in yet. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many years of experience you have, there‚Äôs always room for improvement.\n   Finding the right blend of introducing facts, concepts, and procedures, along with accelerating pattern recognition and fluency through PL technology, is likely to be of maximal benefit to learning in mathematics and many other domains ‚Äì Kellman et al. (2008)\n Recap   Expertise is available for everyone.\n  How you can accelerate expertise in any domain, including programming.\n  Examples of how to adapt to deliberate practice.\n  Future discussions   As PL technology mostly relies on visual representations, it‚Äôs not clear how it can be adapted to people with visual impairment issues.\n  There is no published research using PL technology with programming. That‚Äôs our focus at hexdevs!\n  How much of the trials design and procedures have to be followed for PL to be effective in a non-experimental environment.\n   My friend, congratulate yourself for getting to the end of this! That was a lot and it‚Äôs normal if you feel overwhelmed.\nTake a break, revisit this a few days later. Take your time.\nBy now, you know best how to work with your brain and leverage on the signs it gives you regarding your cognitive resources management üß†.\nLet me know what surprised you, what are you looking forward to try!\n I also want to thank:\n Thiago Araujo, my partner in my crime.

Let&rsquo;s see what else we can apply from PL research to become a Ruby expert:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Focus on deliberate practice:</strong> Not just practice, practice and practice! Remember: a critical component of accelerating pattern recognition and fluency is to get exposure to a wide range of good examples that embody the relevant structures that you are learning (not just one or two examples).</p></li><li><p><strong>Master the basics:</strong> it&rsquo;s better to know the basics well than have surface knowledge about a couple of things. The better you master the topics, the more you are freeing your cognitive capacity to focus on higher-level problems. If it still takes you lots of time and effort to complete a task or you are just following tutorials without understanding the goal, you won&rsquo;t advance to the next level as much as you expect.</p></li><li><p><strong>Go easy on your brain:</strong> It&rsquo;s cognitively costly to master a topic. To be kind to your brain, take a break after each deliberate practice session.</p></li><li><p><strong>Embrace getting stuck</strong>: when you reach the point of &ldquo;I am super stuck, I suck!&rdquo; there&rsquo;s a lot of information for you to take action. You are probably trying to rush something, or missing a crucial step. Learning what you don&rsquo;t know yet is not bad, it&rsquo;s information! Ask yourself: what I am missing here? Asking open-ended questions that gets your brain picking up on clues is more actionable than announcing your defeat.</p></li><li><p><strong>Always be sharpening your knife</strong>: experts are always identifying what skills they are not fluent in yet. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many years of experience you have, there&rsquo;s always room for improvement.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Finding the right blend of introducing facts, concepts, and procedures, along with accelerating pattern recognition and fluency through PL technology, is likely to be of maximal benefit to learning in mathematics and many other domains &ndash; Kellman et al.
